# Introduction

    A file  with  important  links  to  be  searched (used). It is meant to be a
    place  to  put  all  de  links  that  you'll  probably  will  have to search
    again  (and  you'll  probably  wont  find  again).  So, it will avoid double
    search,  because  it  is  better  to  search  in  one  single  file than the
    entire        World        Wide       Web       (I       mean       google).

    You  can  put  some  random things, but try to put them into categories. And
    please,   give   some   description   about   the   link  location,  because
    something like this:
