A file with important links to be searched (used). It is meant to be a place to 
put all de links that you'll probably will have to search again (and you'll 
probably wont find again). So, it will avoid double search, because it is better 
to search in one single file than the entire World Wide Web (I mean google).

You can put some random things, but try to put them into categories. And please, 
give some description about the link location, because something like this:

    â†’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpgknZcuVU

means nothing without a description.
